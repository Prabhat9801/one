        <strong>Subject:</strong> Recommendation for Computer Vision Internship at IIT Bhilai
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p class="no-indent">Dear Sir/Madam,</p>

        <p>I am writing to recommend <strong>Prabhat Kumar Singh</strong> (Roll No: <span class="placeholder">___________</span>), a 5th-semester BTech student in Computer Science & Engineering (Artificial Intelligence) at Chhattisgarh Swami Vivekananda Technical University, Bhilai, for the Computer Vision internship opportunity at IIT Bhilai.</p>

        <p>I have known Prabhat in my capacity as <span class="placeholder">[Faculty Name and Designation]</span> and have observed his academic performance and project work over <span class="placeholder">[duration, e.g., "the past two semesters"]</span>. He has consistently demonstrated strong analytical abilities, dedication to learning, and a genuine passion for artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>

        <p class="section-heading">Academic and Technical Competence</p>

        <p>Prabhat possesses a solid foundation in deep learning architectures including CNNs, RNNs, and transformers, which are fundamental to computer vision applications. His technical proficiency in Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and related frameworks, combined with his experience in deploying production-grade AI systems, makes him well-suited for this intensive training program.</p>

        <p class="section-heading">Project Experience and Achievements</p>

        <p>What particularly impresses me about Prabhat is his ability to translate theoretical knowledge into practical applications. His work on the Production-Grade AI MCQ Platform demonstrates his capability to build scalable, production-ready systems that serve thousands of users with 99.9% accuracy. He has also shown excellent problem-solving skills through his MLOps pipeline project and participation in the Smart India Hackathon, where his team developed a multimodal emotion detection system.</p>

        <p>Prabhat completed the Stanford Machine Learning Specialization with an exceptional score of 99.43%, which reflects his strong grasp of core ML concepts. He has also gained practical industry experience through internships at PRASUNET and Edunet Foundation, where he delivered measurable business impact through his AI solutions.</p>

        <p class="section-heading">Leadership and Personal Qualities</p>

        <p>Beyond technical skills, Prabhat has demonstrated leadership qualities as Vice Web Coordinator of Programmers' Paradise and as a team lead in various competitions. He is sincere, dedicated, and possesses the work ethic necessary to succeed in an intensive six-month offline internship program.</p>

        <p class="section-heading">Recommendation</p>

        <p>I am confident that Prabhat will make the most of this opportunity at IIT Bhilai and contribute meaningfully to any computer vision projects he undertakes. His combination of strong theoretical foundation, practical implementation skills, and dedication to excellence makes him an ideal candidate for this internship program.</p>

        <p><strong>He has my strongest recommendation</strong> for the Computer Vision internship at IIT Bhilai.</p>

        <p>Please feel free to contact me if you require any additional information.</p>
